# RSPO Leakage

#### This repository contains the `R` project set up with the `packrat` package for code used for the analysis in the paper *'Deforestation spillovers from oil palm sustainability certification' (DOI)*. This project has a private project library that installs version of libraries and any dependencies used in the code for this project.


Instructions on how to download and use the code
----------------------------------------------------
1. Download or clone repository to local machine. If the location of the project folder is in a location that is being backed up by a cloud storage service like `Dropbox` or `Microsoft OneDrive`, pause the the syncing process to prevent any issues with the package installation process.

2. Extract files in `data.zip`(`long_kali.csv` & `master_mill_data.csv`) in the `input` folder into the same folder. 

3. Open `R` project file `rspo_leakage.Rproj` in RStudio. Once the project opens, `packrat` will automatically install into the project private library. The `R` session will restart when this is completed.

4. Run `packrat::status()` in the console to see list of packages used in the code that need to be installed for you to run the code.

5. Run `packrat::restore()` in the console to all required packages install packages and dependencies. If required, a window will pop up requesting `RTools` to be installed. Install RTools and then re-run `packrat::restore()` to finishing installing any other packages and dependencies.

6. Once all packages have been installed, open `leakage.R` and run the code. Figures, plot and tables will be saved into the `output` folder.
